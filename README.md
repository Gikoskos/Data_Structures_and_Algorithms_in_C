# EduDS

A collection of data structures implemented in C (EduDS = Educational Data Structures).

## Building

Create a new `build` folder in the root of the repository, and run

    cmake ..
from inside that folder. For example on a Linux terminal:

```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
```

on Windows cmd.exe:

```
mkdir build & cd build & cmake ..
```

If you'd like to build a DLL/so instead of a static library (which is the default):

```
cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
```

If you'd like to get MinGW makefiles instead of Visual Studio project files on Windows (which is the default):

```
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
```

The Debug build, builds all the tests together with the library, and not separately, and the final binary has debugging symbols:

```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

## Libs used

C99 standard library

[xxHash for getting a hashcode out of data of arbitrary length (it's built as part of the library, not separately)](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/)
