# EduDS

A collection of data structures implemented in C (EduDS = Educational Data Structures).

## Building

Create a new `build` folder in the root of the repository, and run

    cmake ..
from inside that folder. For example on Linux:

```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
```

and on Windows:

```
mkdir build & cd build & cmake ..
```

The default Makefiles, generated by Cmake, will build a static library. If you want to build a DLL/so:

```
cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
```

On Windows, Cmake generates by default Visual Studio project files. If you want to use MinGW you can run:

```
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
```
